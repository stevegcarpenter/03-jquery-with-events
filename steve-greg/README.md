# Project Name

**Author**: Steve and Greg
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This lab is a way for us to utilize many Jquery tools to dynamically display and hide the information we want to display.  We have also used event listeners with jQuery to gain familiarity.

## Getting Started
User needs to clone the repo onto their machine and navigate into the Steve-Greg folder.  Inside the folder they can launch the live-server session or simply open index.html.

## Architecture
We are using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for our main languages.  Additionally we are using jQuery as a library.
